# Parking Space Detection Project

This project aims to detect empty parking spaces in a video using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes the scikit-learn library for machine learning algorithms, OpenCV for image processing, and SVM (Support Vector Machine) as the classifier.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parking-space-detection.git
   

2. Install the required dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage

1. Run the main script:
   
   python main.py

   
2. The program will process the video and output the detected empty parking spaces.

## Technologies Used

- scikit-learn: Machine learning library for training SVM classifier.
- OpenCV: Computer vision library for image processing and analysis.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the need for efficient parking space management in urban areas. Special thanks to the contributors of scikit-learn and OpenCV for their amazing libraries.

Happy parking space detection! 🚗🅿️
